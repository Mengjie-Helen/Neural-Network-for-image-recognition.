# Neural-Network-for-image-recognition.
Neural Network and Deep Learning are vitual tool for doing photo tagging, speech recognition and other useful applications.
Here I wrote the simplest version of Neural Network model- Linear Regression and used it to do image classification. It is a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images. Test accuracy is 68%.
Then I applied different learning rates. The learning rate determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate. By testing different learning rates, I concluded different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results. If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost).
Also I compelted the deep L-layer Neural Networks from forward propagtion and backward propagtion.
I am also familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to my own applications.
